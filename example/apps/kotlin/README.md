# Kotlin Example

🚧 **Under Construction** 🚧

This Kotlin example is not yet implemented. The `generated/` folder contains Forge-generated Kotlin code that can be used to build an Android or Kotlin multiplatform application.

## Coming Soon

- Android app example using the generated models
- Ktor client integration
- Kotlin Multiplatform support

## Generated Code

The `generated/` directory contains Forge-generated Kotlin code including:

- Data classes for models (Task, Project, etc.)
- Enum classes (TaskStatus, TaskPriority, etc.)
- API client interfaces

Stay tuned for updates!
